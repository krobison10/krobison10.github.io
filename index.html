                    <h2>Computer Science Student, University of Washington Tacoma</h2>

                    <p>
                        Hi! Welcome and thank you for checking out my humble, self-made
                        resume website. This website uses my basic html and css skills 
                        to present my resume in a hopefully slightly more impressive format
                        than a pdf document. Enough rambling though, here are some things about me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a Junior at the University of Washington and recently I've 
                        been enthusiastic about learning web development, which is 
                        why I decided to create this website. Below you will find all 
                        of the information that you would find in a regular resume, with 
                        a little added spice. Enjoy!
                    </p>

                        learn more things and work on my next side project. Link to my

                        <h3>GUI Calculator with Java Swing and AWT</h3>
                        <p>Done as the final project for my programming practicum course, this project 
                            possessed multiple traits of a legitimate project. These traits included unit 
                            testing with JUnit, javadoc documentation, and program input/output file logging.
                            The calculator has two modes: integer and floating point mode, the mode can 
                            be switched at any time using the radio buttons. This project gave me a ton of 
                            practice with GUI design using Swing and using JUnit for building testable,
                            effective code. Source code can be found in the

                        <p>Done as the final project for my object-oriented programming course in Java. 
                            This console game was intended to be the culmination of the various skills us
                            students were supposed to have under our belts at that point. There were infinitely many ways to 
                            go about doing this project, but I was satisfied with my result. Source code

                                Being my first real job, I learned a very important skill: customer
                                service. "The customer is always right" is a mentality which
                                may not always be true in a literal sense but is true in the 
                                sense that you must have a customer-oriented process to ever have any
                                hope of success. I beleieve this also applies to building websites and
                                software. If the product doesn't cater to the user or prove useful to 
                                them, then what is its purpose? This drives all of my ideas and design.
